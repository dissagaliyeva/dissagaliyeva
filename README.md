### Hi there 👋
---

I'm Dinara and my interests include deep learning, computer vision, and neuroscience. 

- 🏥 **Work**: I'm a Google Summer of Code's Python developer working for Charite Universitätsmedizin Berlin. 

Here we deal with computational neuroscience 🧠 I'm currently developing an app that converts and validates simulation data to [BIDS standard](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), specifically [BEP034](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NT1ERdL41oz3NibIFRyVQ2iR8xH-dKY-lRCB4eyVeRo/edit?usp=sharing). Why is it necessary? Storing and sharing data, parameters, and code comes in different flavors, and, most of the time, some files are missing. Say, you wanted to replicate the results but the code is missing? To run your own simulations, you will need the exact parameters, right? This app will make sure to have the specifications in a readable format.  

The app is under development but will be live very soon.  


- 🌱 **Learning**: neuroscience, deep learning, writing research papers, contributing to open source

I have discovered neuroscience a couple of months ago, and it got me hooked! Currently, I'm learning the nitty-gritty details about (computational) neuroscience. My goal is to use this knowledge and combine it with the unlimited powers of deep learning 🧠 ➕ 💻


- 🏖️ **Live**: I live in a sunny city of Batumi less than 100m from the beach and a beautiful 7km seafront. 

Batumi is a unique city in Georgia. Even though it is pretty small, it has everything to make a person happy: sea, mountains, beautiful nature, and a small number of people.
